# Safety & Use Notes

This repository provides **analysis and visualization tools** for hydride and SQUID/film data using ARP overlays. It is **not** a lab SOP.

- **High pressure (hydrides):** pressures 100–250 GPa require trained personnel, certified equipment, and PPE. Follow your institution’s HPHT safety policies.
- **Cryogenics / superconducting films:** handle cryogens and high-current supplies per lab rules; observe RF exposure limits.
- **Data interpretation:** overlays are **falsifiers** and quick visual checks. Publish full raw data, error bars, and methods in papers.

If you’re unsure about any procedure, consult your safety office or PI before proceeding.
